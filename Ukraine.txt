Ukraine is not dead yet, and glory, and freedom,
Fate will smile on us, young brothers.
Our fortune tellers will perish like dew in the sun,
Let us, brethren, reign on our side.

We will lay down our soul and body for our freedom.
And we will show that we, brothers, are of the Cossack family.

Let us stand, brothers, in a bloody battle from Xiang to the Don
We will not let anyone rule in our native land;
The Black Sea will still smile, grandfather Dnieper will rejoice,
Even in our Ukraine, a little will ripen.
